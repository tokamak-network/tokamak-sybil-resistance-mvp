/*
Package coordinatornetwork implements a comunication layer among coordinators
in order to share information such as transactions in the pool and create account authorizations.

To do so the pubsub gossip protocol is used.
This code is currently heavily based on this example: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/master/examples/pubsub
